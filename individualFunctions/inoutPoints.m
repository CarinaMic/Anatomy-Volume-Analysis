%% Identify inner and outer points (reference vertices and points inside) - with vertex-to-nearest-neighbour to centreFaces of the Normals

% Input:    pelvisNum: Numeric identifier used only for logging
%           shrink: Structure that already contains fields produced by shrinkInside
%           importData: Combined mesh - mesh of pelvis defect and refined patches 
%           refData: Reference pelvis mesh (vertices,faces)

% Output:   shrink: struct with results added under shrink.inside
